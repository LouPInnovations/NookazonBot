# NookazonBot
This script will autobid for you on a specific product on Nookazon!

To make this work from your end (with the .py scripts rather than the finished product), you must install selenium. 

Also, you must download either Chromedriver or Geckdriver for it to be compatible with Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox

DOWNLOAD LINKS FOR THOSE (YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THE ONE FOR YOUR SPECIFIC SYSTEM): 

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

They should be put in the same folder as your .py file for it to work (You can move them and change path however in the script though)

# NookazonBot
This script will autobid for you on a specific product on Nookazon!

To make this work from your end (with the .py scripts rather than the finished product), you must install selenium. 

Also, you must download either Chromedriver or Geckdriver for it to be compatible with Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox

DOWNLOAD LINKS FOR THOSE (YOU MUST DOWNLOAD THE ONE FOR YOUR SPECIFIC SYSTEM): 

https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

They should be put in the same folder as your .py file for it to work (You can move them and change path however in the script though)

Webscraper folder is when I began this project and thought it was going to turn into a webscraper (OLDEST VERSIONS)

AutoBidder Older Versions folder is where the actual function of the end product began development

Finshed Versions folder contains the finished versions of the bot in .exe format, runnable on windows.

FF stands for FireFox, and CH stands for Chrome. In the finished versions, the numbers following CH stands for the Chrome version.

*****IMPORTANT INFO:

This program works on Windows ONLY.

The folder labeled AutoBidderFF works on Firefox and the ones named AutoBidderCHxx works on Google Chrome. 

xx is the name of version that your Google Chrome is running on (it only works with that version)

*****HOW TO USE:
1. Click on the autobidder program
2. It will prompt you for your username, enter it, then the same will happen for your password. Make sure to enter it properly or else you will not be able to bid on anything!
3. The browser will open up and you will be prompted to type in who/what you want to bid for and for what currency and price
4. The bot will do the rest, navigating to the product's page and list all listings that are MORE RECENT THAN 1 HOUR (as these listings are more likely to respond in a timely manner). You can refer to the listings that are printed and see if any specific one catches your eye. 
5. The program will automatically bid on each of those listings (if applicable)
6. The program will say how many listings it bid on, and will ask you if you want to bid on another product (this time you do not have to re-enter username and password)
